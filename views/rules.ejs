                    <h3>Two Different Prize Systems:</h3>

                    <h4>Experience Prizes:</h4>

                    <p>
                        Students will have the opportunity to participate in exclusive experiences based off the
                        accumulation of Ramblin’ Reward Points. These experiences are set on predetermined dates and
                        have limited capacity. When a student reaches a new prize level, he/she will receive an email to
                        sign up for the experience opportunity. Points will not be deducted upon participation in
                        experience prizes.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Physical Prizes:</h4>

                    <p>Student’s will claim physical prizes based on accumulation of points. Prizes may be claimed at
                        any point in the season. Points will be deducted upon redemption of prize.</p>
